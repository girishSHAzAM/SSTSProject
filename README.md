# SSTSProject
An android mobile application that monitor driver performance, detect crashes and send notifications in case of a supposed crash.

NOTE: CRASH DETECTION REQUIRES FURTHER EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS AND TESTING. THEREFORE, THE FACTOR THAT TRIGGERS THE MEASURES TAKEN IN CASE OF A CRASH, IS A SIMPLE SHAKE OF THE PHONE.
PERFORMANE MONITORING IS DONE BASED ON VARIATIONS PRESENT IN SPEED DATA TAKEN OVER THE COURSE OF A TRIP.

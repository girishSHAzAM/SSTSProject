# SSTSProject
An android mobile application that monitor driver performance, detect crashes and send notifications to a preferred emergency contact in case of a supposed crash.

NOTE: Crash detection requires further experimental analysis and testing. Therefore, the factor that triggers the measures taken in case of a crash, is a simple shake of the phone. Performance monitoring is done based on variations present in speed data taken over the course of a trip.
